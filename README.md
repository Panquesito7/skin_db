# skin_db
A minetest skin mod that uses the skins resources located at http://minetest.fensta.bplaced.net/

This mod allows you to select active skins from over 1100 skins, assign moderator and admin flags plus personal skins to specific players.

Adding skins is a case of dropping the skin texture in the textures folder renamed to character_<number>.png and it's preview plus a textfile with the same name in the meta folder, then using the admin GUI hit the import button. The new skin will appear in the inactive list and can be used immediately.
  
 Texture Info: All textures retain their original license in the meta file
