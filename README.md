# skin_db
minetest skin mod that uses the skins located at http://minetest.fensta.bplaced.net/

This mod allows you to select active skins from over 1000 skins, assign moderator and admin flags plus personal skins to specific players.

Adding skins is as simple as dropping the skin texture in the textures folder renamed to character_<number>.png and a textfile with the same name in the meta folder, then using the admin GUI hit the import button. The new skin will appear in the inactive list and can be used immediately.
  
 License Info: All textures retain their original license in the meta file
